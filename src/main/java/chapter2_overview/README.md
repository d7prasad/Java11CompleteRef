#Notes#

1. Identifiers can contain letters, numbers, underscore, and dollars.
2. Thought underscore is not preferred.
3. Should not start with numbers.
4. Starting JDK9: support for underscore is removed from using it in identifier.
5. Keywords 'const and goto' are reserved but not used.
6. n addition to the keywords, Java reserves four other names.
Three have been part of Java from the start: true, false, and null.
These are values defined by Java. You may not use these words for the names of variables, classes, and so on
7. Beginning with JDK 10, the word var has been added as a context-sensitive, reserved type name.
